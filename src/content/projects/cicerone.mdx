**Introduction: The Quest for Inclusive Navigation**

In today's increasingly complex world, navigating unfamiliar indoor spaces – from bustling university campuses to expansive hospitals and museums – can be a significant challenge for many [user query, 69, 79]. For a **Social Inclusion HCI course**, our team embarked on a project to address this very issue, creating "Cicerone" – a prototype for an indoor navigator [user query, 2]. Our core mission was to design a solution that not only solves the practical problem of wayfinding but also champions **accessibility and social inclusion**, empowering individuals to move through public and publicly accessible private spaces with autonomy and confidence [user query, 1, 18].

**The Challenge: Untangling Indoor Labyrinths**

While outdoor navigation has seen tremendous advancements, indoor environments present unique complexities [user query, 61, 69]. Existing indoor navigation solutions are often limited, outdated, or rely heavily on crowdsourcing, which can impact their feasibility and usability [user query, 67, 68]. For individuals who are blind, visually impaired, or have movement impairments, these challenges are profoundly magnified by factors like unclear signage, physical obstacles, loud noises, and an increased reliance on others for guidance [user query, 69, 73]. Furthermore, the high technology costs and the need for case-by-case customization make widespread implementation difficult [user query, 69]. This project aimed to overcome these hurdles by creating a system that is both technically robust and deeply user-centered.

**Our Process: From Broad Strokes to Tailored Solutions**

Our journey began with extensive **literature reviews** on both outdoor and indoor navigation, identifying existing solutions and their limitations [user query, 67, 69, 75, 76]. We critically assessed how current apps address accessibility, recognizing the need to adapt and refine our project scope, ultimately shifting focus from outdoor to indoor navigation to tackle more specific, pressing needs [user query, 61, 69].

A crucial learning point early on was the initial **lack of specific user personas or scenarios**. To address this, we developed detailed personas – Jane (a completely blind psychology student), Mario (a wheelchair-bound PhD law student), and Steven (a university technician new to the campus) – to anchor the problem and guide our design implications [user query, 86, 87, 89, 91, 92]. This exercise was fundamental in understanding that while **universal design** principles are paramount, creating a **specific and tailored tool** directly addressing particular user needs can be more impactful than a one-size-fits-all solution [user query, 7, 62, 70]. These well-designed specific features often ultimately enhance the experience for all users.

**The Cicerone Solution: Your Indoor Google Maps for All**

The Cicerone prototype is envisioned as an **"indoor Google Maps"** designed to significantly enhance the **accessibility and navigability** of public or publicly accessible private spaces [user query, 6, 1]. The system aims for **precise indoor location** primarily through **Wi-Fi beacons** and will be further strengthened by an **AI-powered GeoLocation model** for accurate positioning inside buildings, even with weak or no Wi-Fi tracking [user query, 6, 1, 4, 33]. A crucial feature is **object and obstacle recognition**, implemented using **AI and Machine Vision**, which helps prevent accidents and improve safety [user query, 6, 4, 8, 33, 37].

Cicerone incorporates **three main modes of navigation** to cater to a diverse user base [user query, 6, 80]:

1.  **Normal Mode**: This provides standard turn-by-turn navigation, including estimated time of arrival, awareness of blocked areas, and the ability to plan multi-stop routes [user query, 83]. It allows for quick personalization during route planning, such as temporarily adjusting for an impairment without changing permanent settings. Sighted users can also benefit from the accessibility features built into the system [user query, 84].

2.  **Visually Impaired Mode**: This mode is specifically tailored for blind and visually impaired individuals [user query, 6, 70, 79]. It leverages **multi-modal navigation**, reducing reliance on visual displays [user query, 84]. Key functionalities include **detailed voice feedback and turn-by-turn audio instructions**, **haptic feedback (phone vibrations)** for important turns or obstacle alerts, and **computer vision with vibrations** to assist with obstacle recognition [user query, 6, 84, 88]. The system is designed for easier screen reader navigation and integrates real-time updates and user-signaled disruptions to provide accurate wayfinding [user query, 6, 88, 93, 94]. For example, a user like Jane, who is completely blind, would receive precise audio guidance and haptic feedback, allowing her to navigate efficiently and be alerted to temporary barriers or misplaced furniture [user query, 88, 93, 94].

3.  **"Stroller Mode" (Movement Impairment Mode)**: This mode accounts for individuals with walking impediments, such as wheelchair users, people with strollers, or those carrying heavy packages [user query, 6, 79, 80, 91]. It guides users along **specific accessible routes that prioritize ramps, automatic doors, and elevators**, while actively **avoiding stairs, narrow, or tight passages** [user query, 6, 84, 90, 92]. The system provides real-time updates on route disruptions, such as an out-of-service elevator, and suggests alternative accessible paths [user query, 90, 96]. Mario, a wheelchair user, would find optimal routes to lecture halls, offices, and even social spaces, while Steven, a technician carrying heavy equipment, would benefit from load-friendly, stair-free routes [user query, 90, 92, 97].

The Cicerone system also aims to provide broader benefits to institutions. These include **reduced need for assistance staff**, **lower costs for physical signage**, and **optimized staff movement** within large facilities [user query, 8, 37]. Beyond the app, the project advocates for **changes in physical spaces** to enhance inclusivity, including redesigning door and pathway dimensions, adopting categorization systems like color coding, and integrating interactive lighting and kiosks at key points [user query, 19, 48]. The system also allows for **crowdsourcing** to highlight social spaces and gather user input on points of interest or issues [user query, 19, 48, 81].

**Reflection and Key Learnings: Designing with Empathy and Impact**

Developing the Cicerone prototype for a **Social Inclusion HCI course** proved to be a profound learning experience, particularly in understanding **how to think and design for specific groups of people** [user query, 7, 2]. This highlighted that while the project embraces principles of **universal design**, the core insight was the necessity of creating a **tailored tool** that directly addresses the unique challenges and needs of particular user groups [user query, 7, 62, 70]. This ensures that while the tool is specific, its well-designed accessibility features ultimately enhance the experience for all users, including those without specific impairments [user query, 66].

A significant personal learning involved the importance of **active listening and gaining insights from real-world interactions**, such such as conversations with my blind friend, which directly informed the design choices and deepened empathy for the target users [user query, 7]. This experience underscored the value of moving beyond theoretical understanding to direct user engagement. Initial project feedback highlighted the need for **more specific user personas and scenarios**, an area that was subsequently developed to better anchor the problem and guide design implications [user query, 62, 63].

Looking forward, if given more time, the next critical step would be to develop a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and then conduct **specific user testing with diverse personas** to gather feedback and iterate on the design [user query, 7, 58]. Additionally, further efforts would be dedicated to **strengthening the project's financial feasibility** [user query, 7, 1, 5, 34]. It became clear that **investments in public space accessibility consistently demonstrate a good Return on Investment (ROI)**, through benefits like reduced staff needs, lower signage costs, and improved well-being and university rankings [user query, 7, 8, 37, 49]. Rough estimates place the full development cost between €120k (if cuts are made) and €200k, with funding strategies involving partnerships with universities, NGOs (like Unione Italiana Ciechi), hospitals, museums, and airports [user query, 1, 5, 34].

The project also prompted reflections on broader implications:

- **Cultural Impact**: While Cicerone aims to increase **autonomy and community bonding** by making spaces more accessible, it also presents a nuanced cultural impact [user query, 18, 47]. The system allows users to navigate independently without asking for directions, which, while empowering, could potentially lead to a **slight reduction in incidental social interactions** [user query, 18, 47].
- **Environmental Impact**: The shift from physical to digital tools, while replacing paper maps, necessitates considering the **environmental footprint of technology**. This includes **carbon emissions from electricity production, water consumption and heat generation associated with AI processing, the impact of blue light emissions from screens, and the critical need for responsible recycling of tech items** [user query, 20, 49].

**Closing: A Step Towards a More Accessible World**

Cicerone represents a significant step towards creating more inclusive and navigable indoor environments. By combining advanced technology with a deep understanding of diverse user needs, we envision a future where everyone can confidently and autonomously explore the spaces around them.
