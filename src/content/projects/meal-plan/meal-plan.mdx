Ever struggled to stick to a meal plan? The research question for this projects come from 4 student's same experience. I was one of them, and I collaborated gathering qualitative data through the use of semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participatory design workshops.

## Challenge

Life makes it difficult to stick to a meal plan. The recent rise of LLMs as tools for apparent infinitely granular levels of customization made me wonder... is a social interaction with a system effective in helping individuals in creating and following planned diets and food habits?

So the research question we came up with is: **_"How can social robots (AI) help in following a personalized meal plan?"_**

## Process

### Ethnographic observations

To kick-start the research and practice in ethnographic observations, I decided with my fellows to observe users consuming or choosing food in their natural setting. I produced a series of notes that were further refined when observing food choices in canteens, supermarkets and a restaurant. Smaller observations were conducted also at vending machines, common kitchens and online forums. All of the observations were non participatory.

- Canteens and restaurant highlighted social aspects of food choices.
- In supermarkets we observed differences on choices based on the age group.
- Some people choose food based on health or nutritional factors, others on convenience or price.
- Intentional choices are often healthier than impulsive ones.

### Semi-structured interviews

As a second step towards triangulation of the data, I conducted 3 semi-structured interviews with individuals who were following a meal plan or had tried to follow one in the past. The interviews were focused on their motivations, pain points and strategies to follow a meal plan, but most importantly the view of technology in their dietary sphere, group and cultural influences on their food choices. As a group, we interviewed 12 subjects.

Interview findings about the main factors influencing adherence to meal plans:

- Meal plan being tailored
- Fit withing time and budget constraints
- Flexibility and variety
- Reward system or social support
- Discovering new foods and recipes

### Focus group

We were intrested in understanding how people interact with each other around food, and hearing them discuss their experiences. This is why we chose to include a focus group in our research design. I facilitated the focus group with 9 participants, making sure everyone had space to express and trying to keep the discussion productive. This was probably the toughest part of the research, as I had never been in such position, and the pressure was high, when summed with the struggle to setup and organize the session.

What the focus group confirmed:

- Personalization is critical (individual needs, taste preferences)
- Time constraints (prep, decision fatigue) are major barriers
- Flexibility is essential (balance, not strict dieting)
- Social and cultural context matter in shaping eating habits

What the focus group added/expanded

- Positive, motivational framing around food (less duty, more fun)
- Trust and simplicity as key factors for AI adoption
- AI seen as complement to nutritionists, not replacement
- Importance of visual, engaging interfaces (pictures, gamification)
- Desire for real-time adaptability (quick substitutions, calculations)
- Age/generational differences in trust toward AI

### Synthesis

For the coding of the data me and my group decided to follow a thematic analysis approach, gradually refining our codes, themes and research question while we progressed with the research.
The observations helped us create a first coding but the research group really was not confident in it. After the interviews, the manual transcription and analysis of the recordings, we came up with numerous new themes.

### Ideation

We combined this research with a participatory design workshop, where we invited participants to co-design a social robot that could help them follow a meal plan. The workshop was structured in 3 main activities:

1. **Introduction and warm-up**: brief intro to the topic, icebreaker activity to
get participants comfortable.{" "}

2. **Brainstorming**: participants were asked to think of themselves as someone else, with specific dietary needs and lifestyle. They were then asked to brainstorm ideas for a social robot that could help this person follow their meal plan. This role-playing activity helped participants think outside their own experiences and consider diverse needs and perspectives.

3. **Prototyping**: participants were asked to create physical prototypes of their idead social robots using common craft materials.

    gap: "20px",
    alignItems: "center",

  />
</div>
## Solution / Outcome

Participants were also askes with to present their prototypes and explain how they would work.
From these presentations we undestood that users look for a system that does not need intensive training to be customized, but can be asjusted with just a few **tweaks**. The ability to create flexible meal plans or to **find alternatives** due to unforseen circumstances is a highly discussed theme too. Lastly, we notice that the preferred interaction mode for these system was always **speech**.

## Reflection

This small scale research was a majestic opportunity for me to explore mixed methods research, and to practice my skills in qualitative data collection and analysis. Before actually experiencing how engaging it was and how insightful the findings were, i must admit that I did not believe participatory design to be this useful. Now I do.

If I had more time and resources, I would have definitely liked to conduct more interviews and focus groups, to have a larger and more diverse sample size, in order to gather more generalizable findings. I would also love to spin up a minimum viable product of the AI meal planner, to test it in real life scenarios and gather feedback from users.

I'm more confident in my skills in conducting interviews and focus groups, and I thank my group-mates for giving me the chance to practice these skills. I also improved my skills in coding and analyzing qualitative data, and the logistics of setting up and facilitating a workshop.

I can provide more data about this project if needed, don't hesitate to contact me!
