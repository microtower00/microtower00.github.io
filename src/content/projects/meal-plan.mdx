Ever struggled to stick to a meal plan? The research question for this projects come from 4 student's same experience. I was one of them, and I collaborated gathering qualitative data through the use of semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participatory design workshops.

## Challenge

Life makes it difficult to stick to a meal plan. The recent rise of LLMs as tools for apparent infinitely granular levels of customization made me wonder... is a social interaction with a system effective in helping individuals in creating and following planned diets and food habits?

So the research question we came up with is: **_"How can social robots (AI) help in following a personalized meal plan?"_**

## Process

### Research

#### Ethnographic observations

To kick-start the research and practice in ethnographic observations, I decided with my fellows to observe users consuming or choosing food in their natural setting. I produced a series of notes that were further refined when observing food choices in canteens, supermarkets and a restaurant. Smaller observations were conducted also at vending machines, common kitchens and online forums. All of the observations were non participatory.

- Canteens and restaurant highlighted social aspects of food choices.
- In supermarkets we observed differences on choices based on the age group.
- Some people choose food based on health or nutritional factors, others on convenience or price.
- Intentional choices are often healthier than impulsive ones.

#### Semi-structured interviews

As a second step towards triangulation of the data, I conducted 3 semi-structured interviews with individuals who were following a meal plan or had tried to follow one in the past. The interviews were focused on their motivations, pain points and strategies to follow a meal plan, but most importantly the view of technology in their dietary sphere, group and cultural influences on their food choices. As a group, we interviewed 12 subjects.

Main factors influencing adherence to meal plans:

- Meal plan being tailored
- Fit withing time and budget constraints
- Flexibility and variety
- Reward system or social support
- Discovering new foods and recipes

#### Focus group

We were intrested in understanding how people interact with each other around food, and hearing them discuss their experiences. This is why we chose to include a focus group in our research design. I had the chance to be the facilitator of the discussion, and I found this step of the research one of the most demanding: first of all, we faced the logistics of organizing a focus group with unfamiliar people for the first time, and on top of that I had to make sure everyone was comfortable and that the discussion would keep flowing.

What the focus group confirmed

- Personalization is critical (individual needs, taste preferences)
- Time constraints (prep, decision fatigue) are major barriers
- Flexibility is essential (balance, not strict dieting)
- Social and cultural context matter in shaping eating habits

What the focus group added/expanded

- Positive, motivational framing around food (less duty, more fun)
- Trust and simplicity as key factors for AI adoption
- AI seen as complement to nutritionists, not replacement
- Importance of visual, engaging interfaces (pictures, gamification)
- Desire for real-time adaptability (quick substitutions, calculations)
- Age/generational differences in trust toward AI

- Methods used: ethnographies, observations, semi-structured interviews, focus group and finally participatory workshop.
- Key findings and patterns you uncovered

### Synthesis

- Coding and clustering of data.
- Insights that guided the design (personas, pain points, motivations).

### Ideation

- Participatory workshop approach.
- Examples of co-created ideas or features suggested.

## Solution / Outcome

- Describe the AI meal planner concept that emerged.
- Key design decisions and rationale (e.g., adaptability, user-centered customization).
- Visuals: mockups, flow diagrams, or workshop artifacts.

## Impact

- What was validated (user interest, feasibility, design directions).
- Potential impact: better adherence to diets, reduced decision fatigue, healthier lifestyles.

## Reflection

- Lessons learned about research methods and participatory design.
- What you would do differently with more time/resources.
- Skills/tools strengthened during the project.
